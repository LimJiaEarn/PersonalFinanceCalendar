## Introduction

This project is a inspired by the numerous excel financial trackers available online but lack personalisation and customisability.
Your finances are recorded on Accounting Rows (#data-dictionary)


This tracker is inspired by numerous excel trackers but lack customisability for different users such as students/working adults.
Henceforth this script is designed with customisability as its highest priority. The design follows closely to a Calendar

You are highly recommended to read the customisation guide to fully utilise the customisation features built in this program.
