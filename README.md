#### Accounting Rows
Accounting Rows are preset rows where you will enter the numerical value of your money movements (e.g. Rent, Meals).
Accounting Rows are split to two types
1) Inflow - Adds to your financials (Salary)
2) Expenses - Deducts from your financials (Meals)


#### Summation Rows
Summation Rows are customised rows where you choose the titles you want to add together for a more personalised overview page.
Example: Miscellaneous row can be added to sum up rows not chosen to presented in overview tab
