# Personal Finance Tracker
Personal Project to explore the Python library - Openpyxl. Its documentation is available at https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

This tracker is inspired by numerous excel trackers but lack customisability for different users. Hence I created a python script that revolves around a user preference for his tracking and create a calendar around it.
